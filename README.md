# redis-cli-clone

This project is a Redis-like clone with a Command-Line Interface (CLI). It allows users to execute basic Redis-like commands such as SET, GET, DEL, EXIST, and KEYS through a text input field. The output is displayed in a CLI output area, providing a simple terminal-like experience.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.

2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The Redis Clone interface will appear.

3. Enter your Redis-like commands in the CLI input field and press Enter to execute them.

4. The output of the commands will be displayed in the CLI output area.

5. You can use commands like SET, GET, DEL, EXIST, and KEYS. The commands are case-insensitive.

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the CLI.
- `redis.js`: The JavaScript file with the main functions responsible for executing Redis-like commands.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file with styles for the CLI.
